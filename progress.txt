## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js 14+ App Router with src/ directory and @/* import alias
- shadcn/ui initialized with Tailwind v4, CSS variables
- MongoDB connection uses global cache singleton pattern in src/lib/db.ts
- Type definitions live in src/lib/types/
- Auth config in src/lib/auth.ts using next-auth
- User model in src/lib/models/user.ts (Mongoose)
- NextAuth v5 beta uses `next-auth/providers/credentials` and `next-auth/providers/github` imports
- Signup is a custom API route at /api/auth/signup (not part of NextAuth)
- Auth pages use route group `(auth)` with login/ and signup/ directories
- shadcn/ui components added via `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`

## 2026-01-28 - US-01
- Implemented sign up and sign in with email/password credentials and GitHub OAuth
- Configured NextAuth.js with JWT sessions (7-day expiry), credentials + GitHub providers
- Created User Mongoose model with email, password (bcrypt hashed), name, emailVerified fields
- Built login page with email/password form and GitHub OAuth button
- Built signup page with name/email/password form and GitHub OAuth button
- Created /api/auth/signup POST route with validation and bcrypt hashing
- Created /api/auth/[...nextauth] route handler
- Added middleware for protected routes
- Updated home page to redirect based on auth state
- Files changed:
  - src/lib/auth.ts (NextAuth config)
  - src/lib/models/user.ts (new)
  - src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts (new)
  - src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts (new)
  - src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx (new)
  - src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx (new)
  - src/middleware.ts (new)
  - src/app/page.tsx (updated to redirect)
  - src/components/ui/ (button, input, label, card, separator via shadcn)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NextAuth v5 beta exports `auth` which can be used directly as middleware export
  - GitHub OAuth auto-creates users in the signIn callback (no adapter needed for basic flow)
  - Email verification is a TODO - placeholder noted in signup route
  - bcryptjs used instead of bcrypt for easier cross-platform install
