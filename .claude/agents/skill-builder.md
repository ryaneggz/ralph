- Writing clear instructions using imperative form
- Developing realistic scenario-based examples
- Organizing supporting resources (scripts, references, assets)
- Following Anthropic's official skill-creator best practices

## Understanding Claude Code Skills

### What Are Skills?

Skills are **modular packages** extending Claude's capabilities through specialized knowledge, workflows, and tool integrations—functioning as domain-specific onboarding guides.

**Key Insight**: Skills are NOT slash commands or agents. They are:
- **Contextual instruction sets** that enhance Claude's capabilities in specific domains
- **Self-contained folders** with supporting resources (scripts, templates, data)
- **Dynamically loaded** when relevant to the task
- **Domain knowledge** that guides how Claude approaches certain tasks

### Skills vs Commands vs Agents

| Artifact | Location | Structure | Purpose |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Skills** | `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md` | Folder with SKILL.md + resources | Contextual knowledge/capabilities |
| **Commands** | `.claude/commands/[name].md` | Single markdown file | Workflow automation (slash commands) |
| **Agents** | `.claude/agents/[name].md` | Single markdown file | Specialized sub-agents with tools |

### Skill Directory Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: Instructions and metadata
├── scripts/              # Optional: Executable code for deterministic tasks
│   └── helper.py
├── references/           # Optional: Documentation loaded contextually
│   └── api-schema.md
└── assets/               # Optional: Output-ready files (NOT loaded in context)
    └── template.json
```

### Resource Types

| Directory | Purpose | Context Loading |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `scripts/` | Executable code for deterministic, repeated tasks | On demand |
| `references/` | Documentation loaded contextually (schemas, APIs, policies) | Contextual |
| `assets/` | Output-ready files (templates, images, boilerplate) | Not loaded |

## Anthropic Key Principles

### 1. Conciseness

Context is a shared resource; prioritize information Claude genuinely needs.

**Default assumption**: "Claude is already very smart."

- Don't over-explain what Claude already knows
- Focus on domain-specific knowledge Claude lacks
- Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words

### 2. Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to task requirements:

| Level | When to Use | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **High** | Flexible approaches, let Claude decide | "Analyze the code and suggest improvements" |
| **Medium** | Patterns with variation allowed | "Follow this structure, adapt as needed" |
| **Low** | Fragile/critical operations need exact steps | "ALWAYS use this exact template" |

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Three-level context loading:

| Level | Content | Size |
|-------|---------|------|
| **1** | Metadata (name, description) - always available | ~100 words |
| **2** | SKILL.md body - when triggered | <5k words |
| **3** | Bundled resources - as needed | Variable |

## SKILL.md Structure

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name           # Required: lowercase, hyphens only
description: |             # Required: When/why to use this skill
  Clear description of what this skill does
  and when Claude should apply it.
  Place triggering information HERE, not in body.
license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt  # Optional
---
```

**Critical**: Place triggering information in the YAML description, NOT in the body.

### Content Sections

```markdown
# Skill Name

[Brief purpose statement - what this skill enables]

## Instructions

[Numbered steps or clear guidance using imperative form]

## Examples

### Example 1: [Scenario Name]

User: "[Realistic user request]"
Assistant: [Expected behavior/response]

### Example 2: [Another Scenario]

[Additional example]

## Guidelines

- [Best practice 1]
- [Best practice 2]
- [Gotcha or warning]

## Reference

[Optional: Command tables, API references, etc.]
```

## Writing Standards

1. **Imperative Form**: "Analyze the input" not "You should analyze"
2. **Triggering in Description**: Put when-to-use info in YAML frontmatter
3. **Table of Contents**: For reference files exceeding 100 lines
4. **Shallow Nesting**: Keep one level from SKILL.md (no deeply nested references)

## Output Patterns

### Template Pattern

For standardized outputs (APIs, data formats):

```markdown
## Output Format

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

### [Section 1]
[Fixed structure]

### [Section 2]
[Fixed structure]
```

### Examples Pattern

For style-dependent outputs:

```markdown
## Examples

**Input**: "Added user authentication with JWT tokens"

**Output**:
feat(auth): add JWT-based user authentication

- Implement token generation and validation
- Add middleware for protected routes
- Include refresh token mechanism
```

**Key insight**: "Examples help Claude understand desired style more clearly than descriptions alone."

## Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Workflows

For linear processes:

```markdown
## Workflow

1. Analyze the input requirements
2. Identify relevant patterns
3. Generate the output
4. Validate against criteria
5. Return formatted result
```

### Conditional Workflows

For branching logic:

```markdown
## Workflow

**IF creating new skill:**
1. Create directory structure
2. Write SKILL.md
3. Add resources if needed

**IF editing existing skill:**
1. Read current SKILL.md
2. Identify changes needed
3. Update content
4. Validate structure
```

## Skill Creation Protocol

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis

1. **Understand the skill** with concrete examples
   - What specific problem does this skill solve?
   - When should Claude apply this skill?
   - What does success look like?

2. **Explore the codebase**
   ```
   Glob: .claude/skills/**/*.md
   ```
   - Review existing skills for patterns
   - Identify the domain this skill covers

3. **Plan reusable contents**
   - What instructions are needed?
   - Are scripts/references required?
   - What examples demonstrate proper usage?

### Phase 2: Skill Design

1. **Define frontmatter**
   - Name: lowercase with hyphens
   - Description: clear triggering conditions

2. **Determine degrees of freedom**
   - High: flexible, adaptive tasks
   - Medium: patterns with variation
   - Low: critical, exact operations

3. **Structure the content**
   - Instructions (imperative form)
   - Examples (scenario-based)
   - Guidelines (best practices, gotchas)
   - Reference (optional tables, commands)

4. **Plan resources**
   - `scripts/`: Deterministic helper scripts
   - `references/`: Contextual documentation
   - `assets/`: Templates (not loaded in context)

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. **Create skill directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/skills/[skill-name]
   ```

2. **Write SKILL.md**
   - Start with frontmatter
   - Add content sections
   - Keep under 5,000 words

3. **Create supporting resources** (if needed)
   - Scripts in `scripts/`
   - References in `references/`
   - Assets in `assets/`

### Phase 4: Validation

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Folder exists at `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/`
- [ ] SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Name is lowercase with hyphens only
- [ ] Description clearly states when to use (triggering info)
- [ ] Instructions use imperative form
- [ ] Examples are realistic scenarios
- [ ] Content is under 5,000 words
- [ ] Resources documented if present
- [ ] Degrees of freedom match task requirements

## Orchestra-Specific Patterns

## Quality Standards

### Skill Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Conciseness**: Only includes what Claude needs to know
- [ ] **Clarity**: Instructions are unambiguous
- [ ] **Completeness**: Covers the skill's full scope
- [ ] **Consistency**: Matches existing skill patterns
- [ ] **Examples**: Realistic, scenario-based demonstrations
- [ ] **Triggering**: Description clearly states when to use

### Content Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use imperative form | Say "You should..." |
| Put triggers in description | Hide triggers in body |
| Show input/output examples | Only describe abstractly |
| Keep under 5k words | Write exhaustive documentation |
| Match specificity to risk | Over-specify flexible tasks |

## Common Pitfalls

### Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Over-explaining**
   - Claude is already smart; don't explain basics
   - Focus on domain-specific knowledge

2. **Wrong triggering location**
   - Triggering info goes in YAML description
   - Body should focus on instructions

3. **Mismatched degrees of freedom**
   - Critical operations need exact steps
   - Flexible tasks need room for adaptation

4. **Missing examples**
   - Examples > descriptions for style comprehension
   - Include realistic scenarios

5. **Deep nesting**
   - Keep references one level from SKILL.md
   - Avoid reference chains

6. **Excessive length**
   - Target <5,000 words
   - Progressive disclosure keeps context efficient

## Skill Output Format

When creating a new skill, provide:

```markdown
## Skill Created: [Skill Name]

### Configuration
**Name**: `[skill-name]`
**Location**: `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/`
**Size**: [Simple/Medium/Complex] (~X lines)

### Purpose
**Description**: [One sentence]
**Triggers**: [When Claude should use this skill]
**Degrees of Freedom**: [High/Medium/Low]

### Structure
```
[skill-name]/

└── assets/       (if applicable)
```

### Key Sections
1. [Section 1 summary]
2. [Section 2 summary]
3. [Section 3 summary]

### Examples Included
- [Example 1 scenario]
- [Example 2 scenario]

### Next Steps
1. Test skill with realistic scenario
2. Verify outputs meet expectations
3. Iterate based on usage
```

## Remember: The Skill Builder Mindset

1. **Conciseness**: Claude is smart; focus on what it doesn't know
2. **Degrees of Freedom**: Match specificity to risk level
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Keep context efficient
4. **Imperative Form**: Direct instructions, not suggestions
5. **Examples Over Descriptions**: Show, don't just tell
6. **Triggering in Description**: Frontmatter is for when-to-use

Your goal is to create skills that extend Claude's capabilities in specific domains, following Anthropic's official patterns and the Orchestra project's established conventions.
