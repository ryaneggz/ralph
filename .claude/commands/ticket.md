# Ticket

Automate complete ticket-based development workflow from GitHub issue to pull request.

## Variables

ISSUE_URL: $ARGUMENTS.url
SUBAGENTS: $ARGUMENTS.subagents (default: 3)

## Workflow

1. _VALIDATE_ ISSUE_URL format (expected: GitHub issue URL like `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123`)

2. _EXTRACT_ issue details using gh CLI:
    - RUN `gh issue view <ISSUE_URL> --json number,title,body,labels` to fetch issue metadata
    - _PARSE_ the issue number from the response
    - _DETERMINE_ branch type from labels or title:
        - IF labels contain "bug" or "fix" or title starts with "Fix": use `bug/` prefix
        - ELSE: use `feat/` prefix
    - _GENERATE_ branch name: `<prefix>/<number>-<slugified-title>`
        - Example: `feat/656-distro-workers-taskiq` or `bug/123-null-pointer-crash`

3. _CREATE_ worktree from development branch:
    - _DETERMINE_ worktree path: `./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number>`
        - Example: `./.worktrees/feat-656` or `./.worktrees/bug-123`
    - RUN `git fetch origin development` to ensure development is up to date
    - RUN `git worktree add ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> -b <branch-name> origin/development` to create worktree
    - _REPORT_ worktree created at path with branch name

4. _INITIALIZE_ worktree changelog:
    - RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> && bash ../../backend/scripts/changelog.sh` to generate changelog
    - RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> && git add Changelog.md` to stage changelog
    - RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> && git commit -m "init <branch-name>"` to commit initialization

5. _CREATE_ spec folder for artifacts:
    - _DETERMINE_ spec folder path: `.claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/`
        - Example: `.claude/plans/feature-656-distributed-workers-taskiq/`
    - RUN `mkdir -p ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number>/.claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>` to create spec folder
    - _STORE_ spec folder path for later reference

6. _GENERATE_ user stories from issue:
    - _ANALYZE_ issue title, body, and labels to derive user stories
    - _FORMAT_ user stories using standard template:

        ```markdown
        # User Stories

        ## Issue #<number>: <title>

        ### Story 1: <Primary User Story>

        **As a** <user type>,
        **I want** <capability/feature>,
        **So that** <benefit/value>.

        **Acceptance Criteria:**

        - [ ] <Criterion 1>
        - [ ] <Criterion 2>
        - [ ] <Criterion 3>

        ### Story 2: <Secondary User Story> (if applicable)

        ...

        ## Notes

        - <Any edge cases or considerations from the issue>
        ```

    - _DERIVE_ stories by:
        - Identifying the primary user persona (developer, end-user, admin, etc.)
        - Extracting the core capability being requested
        - Inferring the business value or user benefit
        - Converting issue requirements into testable acceptance criteria
    - _WRITE_ user stories to `.claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/USER_STORIES.md`
    - _REPORT_ "Generated <N> user stories for PR review"

7. _PREPARE_ team query from issue with user stories:
    - _COMPOSE_ query string:

        ```
        GitHub Issue #<number>: <title>

        ## Description
        <body>

        ## User Stories
        <content from USER_STORIES.md>
        ```

    - _ENSURE_ full issue context AND user stories are captured for team analysis
    - User stories provide clear acceptance criteria for agent proposals

8. _INVOKE_ team workflow from worktree:
    - RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number>` to change to worktree directory
    - _EXECUTE_ `/team query="<composed-query>" subagents=$SUBAGENTS output_dir=".claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/"` to run multi-agent implementation workflow
    - The team workflow will generate artifacts into `.claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/`:
        - Phase 0: Context initialization from CLAUDE.md → `INITIAL_REPORT` (in memory)
        - Phase 1: Generate expert proposals → `PROPOSAL_ARCHITECT.md`, `PROPOSAL_CRAFTSMAN.md`, `PROPOSAL_GUARDIAN.md`
        - Phase 2: Council review and synthesis → `REVIEW.md`
        - Phase 3: Task contract generation → `TASKS.md`
        - Phase 4: Implementation execution → Code changes
        - Phase 5: Testing and validation → Updates `TASKS.md` with validation results
    - _MONITOR_ team workflow progress through all phases

9. _VERIFY_ implementation completion:
    - _CHECK_ that `.claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/TASKS.md` shows all tasks completed
    - _CHECK_ that validation phase passed successfully
    - RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> && git status` to confirm all changes committed
    - _IF_ uncommitted changes exist:
        - _REPORT_ "Found uncommitted changes. Committing final changes..."
        - RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> && git add .` to stage all changes
        - RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
          Complete implementation for issue #<number>

        Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
        EOF
        )"` to commit with attribution

10. _CREATE_ pull request:

- RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> && git push -u origin <branch-name>` to push branch to remote
- _GENERATE_ PR body from spec folder artifacts:

    ```markdown
    ## Summary

    Resolves #<issue-number>

    <Brief summary from .claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/REVIEW.md>

    ## User Stories

    <Include user stories from .claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/USER_STORIES.md>

    **Reviewer:** Use these acceptance criteria to validate the implementation.

    ## Implementation

    <Key implementation points from .claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/TASKS.md>

    ## Testing

    <Validation results from .claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/TASKS.md>

    🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
    ```

- RUN `cd ./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number> && gh pr create --base development --title "<Issue title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<composed-pr-body>
EOF
)"` to create pull request targeting development branch
- _CAPTURE_ PR URL from command output

11. _REPORT_ workflow completion:

- Issue processed: #<number> - <title>
- Worktree location: `./.worktrees/<prefix>-<number>`
- Spec folder: `.claude/plans/<prefix>-<number>-<short-name>/`
